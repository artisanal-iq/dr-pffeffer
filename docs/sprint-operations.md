# Sprint Operations Guidelines

To keep the sprint board resilient when unexpected issues appear, follow these guardrails every iteration:

## 1. Reserve Capacity for Unplanned Work
- During sprint planning, block out **up to four story points** as an “unplanned work” buffer.
- Track the buffer explicitly on the sprint board (e.g., a placeholder ticket or swimlane note) so the team can see remaining capacity at a glance.
- Only pull planned backlog items once the buffer is established to avoid accidental overcommitment.

## 2. Log Bugs Against the Buffer
- Whenever a new defect is discovered mid-sprint, create a **child task linked to the buffer item**.
- Capture reproduction steps, severity, and expected fix scope in the child ticket to improve estimation accuracy.
- Update the buffer’s remaining points as fixes are completed so remaining headroom is visible.

## 3. Monitor Burn-Down Daily
- Review the sprint burn-down chart each day to confirm the buffer is still intact or consciously consumed.
- If unplanned work threatens to exceed the four-point allocation, initiate a trade-off conversation (e.g., descoping a planned story or extending the sprint).
- Note any trade-offs in the sprint retrospective to refine future buffer sizing.

Adhering to these practices keeps the team responsive to surprises without silently derailing sprint commitments.
